Dear Ma'am,

Estelle and I have reviewed the requirements for investigating PowerCo's customer retention issue. Below is a detailed outline of the data we need from the client and the techniques we will use to investigate the issue.

Business Understanding & Problem Framing
Objective:
To identify the key factors influencing PowerCo customers' decisions to stay with or switch energy providers and to develop strategies to improve customer retention.

Steps in the Data Science Process:
Business Understanding

Objective: Understand PowerCo's business model, customer base, and the problem of customer churn.
Key Questions:
What are the primary reasons customers switch energy providers?
How does customer churn impact PowerCo's revenue and operations?
Data Understanding

Data Needed:
Customer Demographics: Age, gender, income level, location, household size.
Customer Behavior: Energy usage patterns, billing history, payment methods, interaction history (e.g., customer service calls).
Customer Feedback: Survey responses, customer satisfaction scores, reasons for switching (if available).
Market Data: Competitor pricing, market trends, availability of renewable energy options.
Contract Details: Contract length, type (fixed vs. variable), pricing details.
Data Sources: Internal databases, customer surveys, market research reports.
Data Preparation

Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize data formats.
Data Integration: Combine data from different sources to create a comprehensive dataset.
Feature Engineering: Create new variables that might help in analysis (e.g., average monthly usage, length of time as a customer).
Modeling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Techniques: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, data visualization (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots).
Purpose: Identify patterns and relationships in the data.
Predictive Modeling:
Techniques: Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting.
Purpose: Develop models to predict customer churn and identify key factors.
Evaluation

Model Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC.
Validation Techniques: Cross-validation, train-test split.
Interpretation: Understand the significance of different variables in predicting churn.
Deployment

Implementation: Develop strategies based on model insights to reduce churn (e.g., targeted marketing campaigns, improved customer service).
Monitoring: Continuously track model performance and update as necessary.
Key Factors Influencing Customer Decisions:
Price: Competitive pricing, discounts, and promotions.
Energy Type: Availability of clean/renewable energy options.
Customer Service: Quality of customer service, ease of issue resolution.
Contract Flexibility: Contract terms, ease of switching providers.
Reputation: Brand reputation, customer reviews and testimonials.
Location: Regional availability, local regulations and incentives.
Data Analysis and Visualization:
Trend Analysis: Analyze customer purchasing trends over the past 5 years to identify patterns in churn.
Geospatial Analysis: Visualize customer locations to identify regional trends and potential market opportunities.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze customer feedback to gauge satisfaction levels and identify common complaints.
Survival Analysis: Determine the average customer lifespan and factors contributing to customer retention.
By leveraging these techniques, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing customer churn and develop actionable insights to improve PowerCo's customer retention strategies.

Please let us know if you require any further information or adjustments to this plan.

Best regards,
